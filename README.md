## Course Descriptions

This course introduces the theories and practices of socially-engaged software, a DIY and grassroots approach to making software that challenges society?s pre-existing power relations. Through archival materials, technical demonstrations, and site visits, we will study how hackers, activists, and artists incorporate software to challenge authoritarian regimes and uplift communities. Students will form independent research topics throughout the semester and study software as a cultural artifact.
